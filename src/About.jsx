        <p class="main-text">Hi, I’m John Mikolajczyk, an MBA candidate at Alfred University, where I’m working toward my Master of Business Administration. My goal is to further my education and grow into a leadership role as the lead of a software engineering team. I recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Colorado State University, where I cultivated a strong foundation in technology and problem-solving. </p>
        <p class="main-text">In addition to staying up-to-date with industry trends, I spend my free time watching educational videos and exploring how technology shapes the business landscape. My creative outlet is weightlifting, and I recently competed in my first powerlifting meet—an experience I can’t wait to repeat. I’m also an avid sports fan who loves volleyball, football, and cheering for the Buffalo Bills.</p>
