        <p class="main-text">Hi, I’m John Mikolajczyk, an MBA candidate at Alfred University, where I’m working toward my Master of Business Administration. My goal is to further my education and grow into a leadership role as the lead of a software engineering team. I recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Colorado State University.</p>
        <p class="main-text">In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, spending time with family, and weightlifting. I actually recently competed in my first powerlifting meet and I cannot wait to do it again. I’m also an avid sports fan who loves to play volleyball and spend my Sundays cheering for the Buffalo Bills.</p>
